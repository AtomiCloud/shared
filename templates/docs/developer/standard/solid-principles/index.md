# SOLID Principles

SOLID is the disciplined framework for managing dependencies, achieving low coupling and high cohesion. These five principles -- and a set of corollaries -- tell you **when** to group things together and **how** to keep groups independent from each other. They are the structural laws of every AtomiCloud codebase.

This article builds on the foundational ideas in [Software Design Philosophy](../software-design-philosophy/index.md) -- changeability as the goal, locality as the core property, dependencies as the root problem, and the tension between coupling and cohesion. Everything else in the AtomiCloud stack -- [Functional Practices](../functional-practices/index.md), [Domain-Driven Design](../domain-driven-design/index.md), [Three-Layer Architecture](../three-layer-architecture/index.md), and [Stateless OOP with Dependency Injection](../stateless-oop-di/index.md) -- builds on top of these principles.

## S -- Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

> A class should have only one reason to change.

The word "responsibility" does not mean "one thing it does." A class that handles CRUD for customers does four things, but they all change for the same reason. That is one responsibility.

### Reason to Change vs Rate of Change

There are two ways to think about cohesion:

**Reason to change (white-box):** This is the intrinsic property. Why would this code need to change? What external force drives the change? Tax law changes? Marketing campaign? Database migration?

**Rate of change (black-box):** This is the observable metric. How often does this code change? Does it change on the same commits as other code?

Rate of change is easier to observe -- you can measure it from git history. But reason to change is the underlying truth. We observe rate of change because it reveals reason to change. If two pieces of code change on the same commits over and over, they probably share a reason to change.

### The Absolute Rule: No Private Methods

AtomiCloud code has **zero private methods**. Every private method is a hidden dependency. Every hidden dependency is a testing obstacle. Every helper should be extracted as an injectable service.

---

## O -- Open-Closed Principle (OCP)

> Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

OCP means you can change what the system does without changing the code that already exists. It is about **parameterization** -- making the moving parts configurable rather than hardcoded.

### The Spectrum of Openness

```
// Fully closed -- hardcoded behavior
function addClosed()
  return 3 + 5

// Opened one level -- parameterized input
function addOpened(a, b)
  return a + b

// Opened further -- parameterized behavior
function addEvenMoreOpened(a, b, combine)
  return combine(a, b)
```

### Why OOP, Not Higher-Order Functions

Functional style is **too powerful and too free**. When every argument can be a function of functions, anyone can do anything in any order. OOP provides a **more restricted framework** -- interfaces standardize what is opened up and how it is opened. `IVersionControl` tells you something that `(string) -> void` does not.

Methods should always take value-types as arguments. If a method needs behavior, the constructor should receive another object -- an interface with a name, a contract, and a testable identity.

### Classes as Config/DI Containers

Class members are **only** one of two things:

1. **Configuration values** -- immutable data set at construction time.
2. **Injected services** -- interfaces provided at construction time.

No mutable state. No fields that change after construction.

```
class Enricher
  constructor(
    client: IClient,          // injected service
    encryptor: IEncryptor,    // injected service
    logger: ILogger,          // injected service
    config: EnricherConfig    // configuration
  )

  enrich(data: InputData) -> Result<OutputData>
    // use this.client, this.encryptor, this.logger, this.config
    // but never mutate them
```

---

## L -- Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

> Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.

LSP is a **constraint** on how you implement interfaces. Every implementation must honor the full contract -- including implicit behavioral promises.

Classes model **concepts**, not instances. Design-time hierarchies are about **behavioral contracts**. Runtime instances are about **data conformance**. Do not conflate them.

AtomiCloud discourages subclassing (`extends`). Implement interfaces instead.

---

## I -- Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

> No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.

ISP governs **interface design** from the consumer's perspective. Design interfaces for **how users use them**, not for how implementations are structured.

Different from SRP: SRP would not separate `push` from `pop` on a stack (same reason to change). But ISP would if a client only pushes:

```
interface Pusher
  push(item) -> void

interface Popper
  pop() -> Item

class Stack implements Pusher, Popper
  push(item) -> void
  pop() -> Item
```

---

## D -- Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

> High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

DIP is the **core binding principle**. Without DIP, all the other principles are theoretical.

```
A -> B           // A breaks when B changes

A -> X <- B      // X is an interface; A and B are decoupled
```

This pattern is the origin of everything:

- **ISP** exists because `X` should be minimal.
- **LSP** exists because `B` must honor `X`'s contract.
- **OCP** is achieved because behavior is swappable behind `X`.
- **SRP** is enforceable because `X` defines a focused contract.

### Visible + Fixed

A dependency is **visible** when you can see everything the code needs by looking at its signature -- the constructor for a class, the parameters for a function. You should not need to open the method body to discover hidden dependencies.

A dependency is **fixed** when it is immutable after construction. The reference never changes. The behavior never changes.

```
// WRONG -- not visible, not fixed
class OrderService
  processOrder(order)
    Logger.log("Processing order")    // hidden dependency on Logger
    return Database.query(...)        // hidden dependency on Database
```

```
// RIGHT -- visible and fixed
class OrderService
  constructor(logger: ILogger, db: IDatabase)
    this.logger = logger   // visible in constructor, fixed reference
    this.db = db           // visible in constructor, fixed reference

  processOrder(order)
    this.logger.log("Processing order")
    return this.db.query(...)
```

---

## No Singletons

If everything is a class, everything is injectable. If everything is injectable, everything is swappable. Nothing is hardwired.

### Rules

- **No static methods** that contain business logic.
- **No singletons.** Create instances at the entry point and inject them.
- **No global state.** Values flow through the dependency tree.

A static method cuts through the DI tree. You cannot swap it for a silent logger in tests, a structured logger in production, or a per-module logger.

```
// WRONG -- static global
static Logger.log("User logged in")    // decree from the universe

// RIGHT -- injected collaborator
class UserService
  constructor(logger: ILogger)

  login(user: User) -> Result<Session>
    this.logger.log("User logged in")  // request to a collaborator
```

---

## Temporal Coupling

Temporal coupling occurs when the order of operations matters, but the code does not enforce it. This is a subtle form of hidden dependency.

```
// WRONG -- temporal coupling: must call setTable before build
class QueryBuilder
  private table: string?
  private columns: string[]?

  setTable(t: string)
    this.table = t

  setColumns(cols: string[])
    this.columns = cols

  build() -> Query
    // crashes if table or columns not set!
```

```
// RIGHT -- no temporal coupling: constructor enforces required state
class QueryBuilder
  constructor(table: string, columns: string[])

  build() -> Query
    // always works
```

```
// WRONG -- stateful service with temporal coupling
class OrderService
  private items: Item[] = []

  addItem(item: Item)
    this.items.push(item)

  calculateTotal() -> Money
    return sum(this.items)
```

```
// RIGHT -- all data flows through parameters
class OrderService
  calculateTotal(items: Item[]) -> Money
    return sum(items)
```

## Quick Checklist

- [ ] **SRP:** Does each class have one reason to change? Do things that change for different reasons live in different classes?
- [ ] **OCP:** Can behavior be changed by injecting different implementations rather than editing existing code?
- [ ] **LSP:** Does every implementation honor the full behavioral contract of its interface -- including implicit promises?
- [ ] **ISP:** Does each interface contain only the methods its consumers actually use? Are large interfaces split into focused ones?
- [ ] **DIP:** Do high-level modules depend on interfaces, not concrete implementations? Is all wiring done at the composition root?
- [ ] **No private methods:** Are there zero private methods? Is every helper extracted into its own injectable service?
- [ ] **No singletons:** Are there zero singletons or static methods with business logic? Is everything injectable?
- [ ] **Immutable members:** Are all class fields set in the constructor and never mutated? Are members only config values or injected services?
- [ ] **Methods take value types:** Do methods receive data as parameters (not stored in fields) and return data as results?
- [ ] **Visible dependencies:** Can you see every dependency by looking at the constructor signature, without reading method bodies?
- [ ] **Fixed references:** Do dependencies remain unchanged after construction?
- [ ] **No temporal coupling:** Does the order of method calls not matter? Are objects ready to use after construction?
